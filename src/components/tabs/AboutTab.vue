        <p>
            Hi, thanks for downloading my application! This is an attempt at making good online practices more accessible
            to people who are not as familiar with hashing concepts. The goal is a well organized, good looking interface
            for hashing files and verifying their integrity.
        </p>
        <p>While most of the application is fairly stable, the file encrytion/decryption functionalities are still in beta.
            So make sure you <span class="font-weight-bold"> first back up </span> anything that you are planning to encrypt
        </p>
